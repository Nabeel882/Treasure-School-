// This file has been refactored into multiple modules to make it more manageable.
// The logic previously in this file has been split into the following new files:
//
// - main.js: The new main application entry point. It handles game flow, event listeners,
//   and orchestrates the other modules.
//
// - config.js: Contains static configuration data like level templates, vocabulary, themes, etc.
//
// - gameState.js: Manages the game's state, including player data, score, unlocked levels,
//   and handles saving/loading progress to localStorage.
//
// - audio.js: Manages all audio-related functionality, including loading and playing sounds
//   and music using the Web Audio API.
//
// - levels.js: Handles the procedural generation of game levels.
//
// - ui.js: Manages all DOM manipulation and UI updates, such as showing screens,
//   rendering challenges, and displaying feedback.
//
// The old single-file script has been removed from here.
